Directory & file structure:

<base directory> cmdLineVersion on my machine, should not matter

  build.sh 	 // Builds all, including creating all classes from WSDL, web chat server must be runnable for client to build
  ChatServer.dat // configuration file (only one item in it, the admin password)
  
  chatserver
	// Chat server classes
  	WebChatPublisher.java   // Class that publishes the web chat server
	ChatServer.java  	// The main server class	
	User.java  		// Class for a single user
	Users.java 		// ArrayList of users, and many methods for managing the user list

  webchatclient
	WebChatClientForm.java  // The client
	client
		All WebService java and classes are autogenerated in here by build.sh
		by wsimport
	
Needs : CLASSPATH :.:./webchatclient/
NOTE WebChatClientForm has lots of autogenerated code from netBeans GUI builder, but the working parts, and the GUI, are all 
my own work.

build.sh does:
  1 kill existing webchatserver process (if any)
  2 javac all java files in webchatserver
  3 runs the server as a detached process
  4 Waits for it to start
  5 runs wsimport to generate classes from the WSDL
  6 Builds the client java 
  7 Starts 3 client processes (detached)


javac webchatclient/*.java
and
javac chatserver/*.jaja
works as they should and build all the classes, PROVIDED
wsimport -p client -keep http://localhost:8080/wc?wsdl
is run in directory chatserver
